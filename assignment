Assignment 1: Shape Area Calculation
Create a parent class Shape with a method calculateArea() that prints "Area calculation not defined for Shape."
Create subclasses:
Circle that overrides calculateArea() to calculate and print the area of a circle.
Rectangle that overrides calculateArea() to calculate and print the area of a rectangle.
Write a Main class to demonstrate polymorphism using an array of Shape objects.

2.
Create a parent class Animal with a method makeSound() that prints "Some generic sound."
Create subclasses:
Dog that overrides makeSound() to print "Woof Woof."
Cat that overrides makeSound() to print "Meow Meow."
In the Main class, use polymorphism to call makeSound() on different Animal objects.

Assignment 3.
Create a parent class Bank with a method getInterestRate() that returns 0.
Create subclasses:
SBI that overrides getInterestRate() to return 5.
ICICI that overrides getInterestRate() to return 6.
Axis that overrides getInterestRate() to return 7.
In the Main class, demonstrate method overriding by calling getInterestRate() on different bank objects.

Assignment 4:
Create a parent class Vehicle with a method speed() that prints "Speed varies for different vehicles."
Create subclasses:
Car that overrides speed() to print "The car speed is 120 km/h."
Bike that overrides speed() to print "The bike speed is 80 km/h."
Use polymorphism to display the speed of different vehicles in the Main class.

Assignment 5:
Create a parent class Employee with a method calculateSalary() that prints "Base salary calculation for Employee."
Create subclasses:
Manager that overrides calculateSalary() to add a bonus to the base salary.
Developer that overrides calculateSalary() to calculate salary based on hours worked.
Demonstrate the overridden method in the Main class by creating an array of Employee objects and calling calculateSalary() on each.
