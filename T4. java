/*
Assignment 4:
Create a parent class Vehicle with a method speed() that prints "Speed varies for different vehicles."
Create subclasses:
Car that overrides speed() to print "The car speed is 120 km/h."
Bike that overrides speed() to print "The bike speed is 80 km/h."
Use polymorphism to display the speed of different vehicles in the Main class.
