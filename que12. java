Scenario 1: Payment Processing System
You are developing a payment processing system to handle various payment methods.

Abstract Class:

Create an abstract class Payment with the following:
Fields:
double amount
String transactionID
Constructor to initialize the fields.
Abstract method processPayment().
Concrete method displayDetails() to print the transaction ID and amount.
Subclasses:

Create the following subclasses:
CreditCardPayment:
Additional field: String cardNumber.
Override processPayment() to print "Processing credit card payment for amount: $[amount].".
PaypalPayment:
Additional field: String paypalID.
Override processPayment() to print "Processing PayPal payment for amount: $[amount]."
Main Class:

Create instances of both CreditCardPayment and PaypalPayment.
Call processPayment() and displayDetails() for each object.
